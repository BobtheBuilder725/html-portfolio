<h1>The Best Movies According to Berhan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Godfather Trilogy</h3>
<p>The whole trilogy is amazing, but The Godfather 1, is the greatest movie i have ever seen, the breathtaking cinematography, the complex characters, the rich storyline. This is an easy 10/10</p>
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>I love movies about hope, and no movie truly embodies "hope" better than Shawshank Redemption. </p>
<h3>Bridge to Terabithia</h3>
<p>A Childhood movie that has wonderful cgi for how old it is, great story, nostalgic music and just wholesome.</p>
